               Hello everybody. My name is David Robert Oberg and I am a Jazz Performance and CIS double major. I was born in Palos 	
               Heights , IL, and now currently live in Lodi, WI.
               Ever since I can remember, I've always been fascinated by video games. I consider gaming to be my biggest passion in life,
               just barely in front of music. Music is something I started doing in middle school on saxophone and is what I am currently
               doing today.
