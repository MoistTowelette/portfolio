        <h1>My Passion for Music</h1>

        <p id="musicmain">
        My career with music started the summer before I got into middle school.
        I was going to join band, and my mom thought it would be a good idea to take piano lessons so I could get familiar with music beforehand. Well, it was defintely worth it, as I have played ever since and it has helped with understanding music and music theory to this day. Because of some pretty small choices I made years ago, I am now a Jazz Perfomance major at UWSP and am enjoying every day of it.
