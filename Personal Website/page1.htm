    <h1>My History with Gaming</h1>
    
    
    
    <p id="gameintro">Gaming to me is something that I don't think I'll ever grow out of. Ever since I first started playing 
       Super Mario on Gameboy,
       I've loved every minute of it throughout my life. For the most part, gaming is a part of my everyday routine, whether it it be
       by myself or with a bunch of my friends. Typically, I will play just about anything, just so long as it has a good story.
       Historically, I've played an mostly Nintendo and Sony consoles, but now I play on PC exclusively.
